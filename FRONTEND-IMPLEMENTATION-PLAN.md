# Frontend Implementation Plan
## Advanced Learning System Integration

## Overview
We need to update the frontend to use our new advanced learning system with:
- Spaced repetition algorithm (SM-2)
- Difficulty rating system (Easy/Hard/Forgot)
- Individual word progress tracking
- Category completion management
- Advanced analytics and statistics

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Update API Layer (Priority: High)

### Step 1.1: Create New API Functions
**File: `lib/api/advancedLearning.ts`** (NEW)
- `getWordsForStudy(categoryId: number)` - Fetch words using spaced repetition
- `submitWordResponse(wordId: number, difficulty: 'easy' | 'hard' | 'forgot')` - Submit difficulty rating
- `startStudySession(categoryId?: number)` - Initialize study session
- `endStudySession(sessionId: number)` - Complete study session
- `getUserDashboard()` - Get comprehensive dashboard data
- `getCategoryProgress(userId: string)` - Get category completion status

### Step 1.2: Update Existing API Files
**File: `lib/questionsApi.ts`** (UPDATE)
- Replace old questions API with new words API
- Update CategorySummary interface to include progress data
- Add category completion status

**File: `lib/userStatisticsApi.ts`** (UPDATE)
- Replace with new comprehensive statistics
- Add learning progress metrics
- Include streak and accuracy data

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2: Enhanced FlashcardStudy Component (Priority: High)

### Step 2.1: Add Difficulty Rating System
**File: `components/FlashcardStudy.tsx`** (MAJOR UPDATE)
- Replace single "Next" button with 3 difficulty buttons:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Easy** (green) - "Ð›ÐµÐ³ÐºÐ¾"
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Hard** (yellow) - "Ð¡Ð»Ð¾Ð¶Ð½Ð¾" 
  - ðŸ”´ **Forgot** (red) - "Ð—Ð°Ð±Ñ‹Ð»"
- Update UI to show difficulty buttons after revealing translation
- Add visual feedback for difficulty selection

### Step 2.2: Implement Spaced Repetition
- Use `getWordsForStudy()` instead of old questions API
- Handle dynamic word scheduling based on SM-2 algorithm
- Show learning status indicators (New, Learning, Learned, Mastered)

### Step 2.3: Session Management
- Track session start/end with new API functions
- Show session progress and statistics
- Display words learned in current session

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3: Advanced Student Dashboard (Priority: High)

### Step 3.1: Comprehensive Statistics Cards
**File: `app/student/page.tsx`** (MAJOR UPDATE)
Replace current 2 basic stats with 15+ advanced metrics:

**Learning Progress (Top Row)**
- Words Learned Today
- Total Words Learned  
- Words Mastered
- Learning Accuracy

**Study Activity (Middle Row)**
- Current Streak Days
- Longest Streak
- Total Study Time
- Average Session Time

**Category Progress (Bottom Row)**
- Categories Completed
- Categories in Progress
- Total Categories
- Overall Progress %

### Step 3.2: Category Progress Visualization
- Add progress bars to each category card
- Show completion status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Mastered)
- Reorder categories: active first, completed at bottom
- Add completion badges and icons

### Step 3.3: Enhanced Category Cards
- Display individual category progress
- Show words learned/total words per category
- Add difficulty level indicators
- Include last studied date

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 4: New Components (Priority: Medium)

### Step 4.1: Progress Visualization Components
**File: `components/ProgressBar.tsx`** (NEW)
- Animated progress bars with percentages
- Different colors for different progress levels
- Smooth animations and transitions

**File: `components/StatCard.tsx`** (NEW)
- Reusable statistics card component
- Support for different data types (numbers, percentages, streaks)
- Loading states and animations

**File: `components/LearningStatusBadge.tsx`** (NEW)
- Visual indicators for word learning status
- Color-coded badges (New, Learning, Learned, Mastered)
- Tooltips with explanations

### Step 4.2: Study Session Components
**File: `components/SessionSummary.tsx`** (NEW)
- Post-study session summary modal
- Show words learned, accuracy, time spent
- Progress towards category completion
- Motivational messages and achievements

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 5: Enhanced Study Flow (Priority: Medium)

### Step 5.1: Smart Study Routing
**File: `app/study/[category]/page.tsx`** (UPDATE)
- Check if category has words ready for review
- Show different messages based on spaced repetition schedule
- Handle empty study sessions gracefully

### Step 5.2: Category Completion Flow
- Celebrate category completion with animations
- Move completed categories to bottom of list
- Show achievement notifications
- Update category status in real-time

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 6: TypeScript Interfaces (Priority: High)

### Step 6.1: New Data Types
**File: `lib/types/learning.ts`** (NEW)
```typescript
interface Word {
  id: number
  category_id: number
  chinese_simplified: string
  chinese_traditional?: string
  pinyin: string
  russian_translation: string
  english_translation?: string
  difficulty_level: number
  frequency_rank?: number
  // ... other fields
}

interface UserWordProgress {
  id: number
  user_uuid: string
  word_id: number
  learning_status: 'new' | 'learning' | 'learned' | 'mastered'
  last_difficulty?: 'easy' | 'hard' | 'forgot'
  repetition_count: number
  easiness_factor: number
  interval_days: number
  next_review_date: string
  accuracy_percentage: number
  // ... other fields
}

interface UserStatistics {
  user_uuid: string
  total_words_viewed: number
  total_words_learned: number
  total_words_mastered: number
  current_streak_days: number
  longest_streak_days: number
  overall_accuracy: number
  categories_completed: number
  // ... other fields
}

interface CategoryProgress {
  category_id: number
  total_words: number
  words_learned: number
  words_mastered: number
  completion_percentage: number
  status: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'mastered'
  // ... other fields
}
```
