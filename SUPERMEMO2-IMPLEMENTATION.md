# SuperMemo 2 Algorithm Integration

## üß† Implementation Complete

The SuperMemo 2 spaced repetition algorithm has been successfully integrated into the Chinese learning platform. The implementation focuses solely on the core SM2 logic without modifying any UI components or database structure.

## üìç **What Was Modified**

### **Function:** `submit_word_response()` in `api-functions.sql`
This is the core function that runs when users click "Easy", "Hard", or "Forgot" buttons during flashcard study.

## üîß **SM2 Features Implemented**

### 1. **Category-Based Initial Values**
- **HSK 1** categories: `easiness_factor = 2.6` (easier)
- **HSK 2** categories: `easiness_factor = 2.4` (moderate)  
- **HSK 3+** categories: `easiness_factor = 2.2` (harder)

### 2. **Quality Rating System**
- **Easy** = Quality 5 (Perfect response)
- **Hard** = Quality 3 (Correct but difficult)
- **Forgot** = Quality 0 (Incorrect response)

### 3. **SuperMemo 2 Easiness Factor Formula**
```sql
v_new_easiness := v_current_progress.easiness_factor + 
    (0.1 - (5 - v_quality) * (0.08 + (5 - v_quality) * 0.02))
```
- Minimum easiness factor: `1.3`
- Successful responses increase easiness
- Failed responses decrease easiness

### 4. **Interval Calculation**
- **Failed responses** (quality < 3): Reset to 1 day, repetition_count = 0
- **First success**: 1 day interval
- **Second success**: 6 day interval  
- **Subsequent successes**: `previous_interval √ó easiness_factor`

### 5. **Learning Status Progression**
- **New** ‚Üí **Learning** (first attempt)
- **Learning** ‚Üí **Learned** (3+ repetitions with quality ‚â• 4)
- **Learned** ‚Üí **Mastered** (6+ repetitions with quality = 5)

## üéØ **How It Works**

1. **User clicks Easy/Hard/Forgot** in the flashcard interface
2. **Frontend calls** `submitWordResponse()` API 
3. **Database function** `submit_word_response()` executes with SM2 logic:
   - Converts user response to quality rating (0-5)
   - Retrieves current progress from `user_word_progress` table
   - For new words: queries category difficulty and sets initial easiness factor
   - Applies SM2 formula to calculate new easiness factor
   - Calculates next interval based on repetition count and easiness
   - Updates `user_word_progress` with new values
   - Returns updated progress data

## üìä **Database Fields Updated**

All updates happen in the existing `user_word_progress` table:
- `easiness_factor` - SM2 easiness factor (1.3 to ~4.0)
- `repetition_count` - Number of successful repetitions
- `interval_days` - Days until next review
- `next_review_date` - Calculated review date
- `last_difficulty` - User's last response (easy/hard/forgot)
- `learning_status` - Progression status (new/learning/learned/mastered)

## ‚úÖ **What Was NOT Changed**

- ‚ùå No UI modifications
- ‚ùå No new buttons or interface elements  
- ‚ùå No database schema changes
- ‚ùå No new tables or columns
- ‚ùå No changes to frontend components
- ‚ùå No changes to API endpoints

## üß™ **Testing the Implementation**

The SM2 algorithm is now active and will automatically:
1. Use category-based starting values for new words
2. Calculate optimal review intervals based on user performance
3. Adjust difficulty based on user responses
4. Progress words through learning stages based on mastery

To see SM2 in action:
1. Start a study session with any category
2. Answer flashcards with Easy/Hard/Forgot
3. Check `user_word_progress` table to see SM2 calculations
4. Words will have different `next_review_date` based on performance

## üìà **Expected Benefits**

- **Better Retention**: Optimal spacing between reviews
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Harder words reviewed more frequently
- **Category Awareness**: HSK levels influence starting difficulty
- **Personalized Learning**: Algorithm adapts to individual performance
- **Efficient Study Time**: Focus on words that need most attention

The implementation is fully integrated and requires no additional setup or configuration.
