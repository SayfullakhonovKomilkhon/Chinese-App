# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Project Status
**Status**: ✅ Category Design & Sorting Enhancement COMPLETED  
**Last Major Update**: Enhanced category cards design and implemented smart sorting  
**Primary Focus**: Premium UI experience with proper learning progression visualization

## Recent Changes & Major Updates

### 🎨 **COMPLETED: Category Design & Sorting Enhancement** ✅
**Problem**: Completed categories mixed with incomplete ones, basic card design
**Solution Implemented**:

#### 1. **Smart Category Sorting** ✅
- ✅ **Priority Order**: In Progress → Not Started → Completed → Mastered
- ✅ **Completed Categories**: Now appear at the bottom of the list
- ✅ **Secondary Sorting**: By difficulty level within same status
- ✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between active and completed categories

#### 2. **Premium Category Card Design** ✅
- ✅ **Enhanced Gradients**: Status-based color schemes (blue for active, green for completed)
- ✅ **Completion Badges**: Special badges for completed/mastered categories with trophy icons
- ✅ **Premium Progress Bars**: Animated gradient bars with shimmer effects
- ✅ **Improved Typography**: Better text hierarchy and spacing
- ✅ **Enhanced Hover Effects**: Elevated shadows and smooth transitions
- ✅ **Status Indicators**: Visual opacity and shimmer effects for completed categories

#### 3. **Visual Status System** ✅
**Active Categories**:
- Bright gradients (blue/purple/amber)
- Full opacity
- Enhanced hover effects
- Active learning badges

**Completed Categories**:
- Green emerald gradients
- Reduced opacity (75%)
- Special completion badges
- Subtle shimmer effects
- Positioned at bottom of list

### 🔧 **Previous Fix: Dashboard Statistics Display Issue** ✅
**Problem**: Dashboard showing all zeros despite user having actual learning progress
**Root Cause**: Frontend expected `DashboardStats` interface but API returned raw database structure
**Solution Implemented**:

#### 1. **Fixed API Data Structure Transformation** ✅
- ✅ **Updated `getUserDashboard()` function**: Now transforms database response to match frontend interface
- ✅ **Database returns**: `{ "statistics": {...}, "categories": [...] }`
- ✅ **Frontend expects**: `{ "user_statistics": {...}, "categories_progress": [...], "categories_in_progress": number }`
- ✅ **Added proper mapping**: Categories in progress count, completed count, and all required fields

#### 2. **Verified Current User Statistics** ✅
**Real Data in Database**:
- `total_words_learned: 7` ✅
- `total_sessions: 11` ✅  
- `total_study_minutes: 3` ✅
- `overall_accuracy: 100%` ✅
- `words_learned_today: 11` (needs recalculation)

**Categories Progress**:
- **HSK 1 - Базовый**: 2/5 words learned (40% completion, in_progress) - Active position
- **Базовые фразы**: 2/2 words learned (100% completion, completed) ✅ - Bottom position
- **Еда и напитки**: 3/3 words learned (100% completion, completed) ✅ - Bottom position

### 🎉 **Previous Fix: Learning Data Persistence Issue** ✅
**Problem**: User reported that learned/not learned data was not saving properly
**Root Cause**: Session statistics were hardcoded to 0 in the `endStudySession` function
**Solution Implemented**:

#### 1. **Fixed Session Statistics Tracking** ✅
- ✅ **Updated `endStudySession` API**: Now accepts actual session statistics instead of hardcoded zeros
- ✅ **Enhanced FlashcardStudyAdvanced Component**: Properly calculates and passes session stats
- ✅ **Fixed State Timing Issues**: Ensures statistics are calculated correctly before session completion
- ✅ **Added `completeSessionWithStats` function**: Handles final statistics calculation

#### 2. **Fixed Category Progress Tracking** ✅  
- ✅ **Created Category Progress Trigger**: Automatically updates category completion when words are learned
- ✅ **Added `update_category_progress_for_user` function**: Recalculates category statistics
- ✅ **Fixed Progress Display**: Categories now show correct completion percentages

#### 3. **Verified Data Flow** ✅
**Session Data**: ✅ Working
- `words_studied`: Correctly tracks number of words studied
- `words_learned`: Tracks words marked as "easy" (learned)
- `correct_answers`: Tracks "easy" and "hard" responses
- `total_answers`: Tracks all difficulty responses
- `session_accuracy`: Calculates percentage correctly
- `duration_minutes`: Tracks actual study time

**User Statistics**: ✅ Working  
- `total_words_learned`: Updates correctly (currently 7)
- `total_sessions`: Increments properly (currently 11)
- `total_study_minutes`: Tracks time (currently 3)
- `words_learned_today`: Daily progress tracking (needs adjustment)
- `overall_accuracy`: Calculates correctly (100%)

**Category Progress**: ✅ Working
- **HSK 1 - Базовый**: 2/5 words learned (40% completion)
- **Базовые фразы**: 2/2 words learned (100% completion) - COMPLETED ✅
- **Еда и напитки**: 3/3 words learned (100% completion) - COMPLETED ✅
- Progress updates automatically via database triggers

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

#### Category Sorting Algorithm:
```typescript
const sortedCategories = [...categories].sort((a, b) => {
  const statusPriority = {
    'in_progress': 1,      // Show first
    'not_started': 2,      // Show second
    'completed': 3,        // Show at bottom
    'mastered': 4          // Show last
  }
  // Secondary sort by difficulty level
  return aPriority - bPriority || a.difficulty_level - b.difficulty_level
})
```

#### Premium Design System:
```typescript
// Status-based gradients
const getCategoryGradient = (status, percentage) => {
  switch (status) {
    case 'completed': return 'from-emerald-500/20 via-green-600/15 to-teal-500/20'
    case 'in_progress': return percentage >= 70 
      ? 'from-amber-500/20 via-orange-600/15 to-yellow-500/20'
      : 'from-blue-500/20 via-indigo-600/15 to-purple-500/20'
    default: return 'from-slate-500/20 via-gray-600/15 to-slate-500/20'
  }
}
```

#### API Data Transformation:
```typescript
// Transform database response to frontend interface:
const dashboardStats: DashboardStats = {
  user_statistics: {
    ...dbResponse.statistics,
    categories_completed: categoriesCompleted,
    // ... other mappings
  },
  categories_progress: dbResponse.categories.map(cat => cat.progress).filter(Boolean),
  categories_in_progress: categoriesInProgress,
  // ... other required fields
}
```

#### Automatic Triggers Added:
- `trigger_update_category_progress()`: Updates category completion after each word response
- `update_category_progress_for_user()`: Recalculates all category statistics

## Key Learnings & Insights

### 🧠 **Learning System Psychology**
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users expect instant visual confirmation when words are learned
- **Progress Visualization**: Category completion percentages are crucial for motivation
- **Spaced Repetition**: Scientific approach requires multiple correct responses (not just one)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Completed categories should be less prominent to focus on active learning

### 🎨 **UI/UX Design Patterns**
- **Status-Based Design**: Different visual treatments for different learning states
- **Smart Sorting**: Progressive disclosure with most relevant content first
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Subtle gradients and animations enhance perceived value
- **Completion Celebration**: Special visual treatment for achievements motivates continued learning

### 🔧 **Technical Patterns**
- **State Timing**: React state updates are asynchronous - calculate final values before API calls
- **Database Triggers**: Automatic data consistency through triggers is more reliable than manual updates
- **API Design**: Functions should accept parameters rather than hardcoding values
- **Data Structure Mapping**: Frontend interfaces must match API response structures exactly
- **Component Composition**: Reusable design systems with configurable variants

## Current Development Environment

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Database Query Patterns
```sql
-- Spaced repetition word selection
SELECT * FROM get_words_for_study(user_uuid, category_id, limit)
-- Difficulty response processing
SELECT submit_word_response(user_uuid, word_id, difficulty, correct, time)
-- Dashboard data aggregation
SELECT get_user_dashboard(user_uuid)
```

### Frontend Integration Patterns
```typescript
// Difficulty rating submission
const handleDifficultyResponse = async (difficulty: 'easy' | 'hard' | 'forgot')
// Session management
const sessionData = await startStudySession(categoryId)
// Progress tracking
const dashboardData = await getUserDashboard()
```
